## Overview
The `rosetta-cli` is used by developers to test the correctness of their Rosetta
API implementations. The CLI also provides the ability to look up block contents
and account balances.

## Documentation
Before diving into the CLI, we recommend taking a look at the Rosetta API Docs:

* [Overview](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/welcome.html)
* [Data API](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/data_api_introduction.html)
* [Construction API](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/construction_api_introduction.html)

```

### Configuration
All `rosetta-cli` parameters are populated from a configuration file (`--configuration-file`)
provided at runtime. If a configuration file is not provided, the default
configuration is used. This default configuration can be viewed
[here](examples/configuration/default.json). Note, there is no default
configuration for running `check:construction` as this is very network-specific.
You can view a full list of all configuration options [here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sidhujag/rosetta-cli/configuration).

In the `examples/configuration` directory, you can find examples configuration
files for running tests against a Bitcoin Rosetta implementation
([config](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-bitcoin/tree/master/rosetta-cli-conf)) and an Ethereum Rosetta
implementation ([config](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-ethereum/tree/master/rosetta-cli-conf)).

#### Writing check:construction Tests
The new Construction API testing framework (first released in `rosetta-cli@v0.5.0`) uses
a new design pattern to allow for complex transaction construction orchestration.
You can read more about the design goals [here](https://community.rosetta-api.org/t/feedback-request-automated-construction-api-testing-improvements/146).

Most teams write their Construction API tests using the
[Rosetta Constructor DSL](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go/tree/master/constructor/dsl).
We have examples of a DSL files written for [UTXO-based chains](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-bitcoin/blob/master/rosetta-cli-conf/testnet/bitcoin.ros)
and [account-based chains](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-ethereum/blob/master/rosetta-cli-conf/testnet/ethereum.ros).

##### Terminology
When first learning about a new topic, it is often useful to understand the
hierarchy of concerns. In the automated Construction API tester, this
"hierarchy" is as follows:
```text
Workflows -> Jobs
  Scenarios
    Actions
```

`Workflows` contain collections of `Scenarios` to execute. `Scenarios` are
executed atomically in database transactions (rolled back if execution fails)
and culminate in an optional broadcast. This means that a single `Workflow`
could contain multiple broadcasts (which can be useful for orchestrating
staking-related transactions that affect a single account).

To perform a `Workflow`, we create a `Job`. This `Job` has a unique identifier
and stores state for all `Scenarios` in the `Workflow`. State is shared across
an entire `Job` so `Actions` in a `Scenario` can access the output of `Actions`
in other `Scenarios`. The syntax for accessing this shared state can be found
[here](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md).

`Actions` are discrete operations that can be performed in the context of a
`Scenario`.  A full list of all `Actions` that can be performed can be found
[here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go/constructor/job#ActionType).

If you have suggestions for more actions, please
[open an issue in `rosetta-sdk-go`](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go/issues)!

##### Workflows
To use the automated Construction API tester (without prefunded accounts),
you must implement 2 required `Workflows`:
* `create_account`
* `request_funds`

_If you don't implement these 2 `Workflows`, processing could stall._

Please note that `create_account` can contain a transaction broadcast if
on-chain origination is required for new accounts on your blockchain.

If you plan to run the automated Construction API tester in CI, you may wish to
provide [`prefunded accounts`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sidhujag/rosetta-cli/configuration#ConstructionConfiguration)
when running the tester (otherwise you would need to manually fund generated
accounts).

Optionally, you can also provide a `return_funds` workflow that will be invoked
when exiting `check:construction`. This can be useful in CI when you want to return
all funds to a single accout or faucet (instead of black-holing them in all the addresses
created during testing).

##### Broadcast Invocation
If you'd like to broadcast a transaction at the end of a `Scenario`,
you must populate the following fields:
* `<scenario>.network`
* `<scenario>.operations`
* `<scenario>.confirmation_depth` (allows for stake-related transactions to complete before marking as a success)

Optionally, you can populate the following field:
* `<scenario>.preprocess_metadata`

Once a transaction is confirmed on-chain (after the provided
`<scenario>.confirmation_depth`, it is stored by the tester at
`<scenario>.transaction` for access by other `Scenarios` in the same `Job`.

##### Dry Runs
In UTXO-based blockchains, it may be necessary to amend the `operations` stored
in `<scenario>.operations` based on the `suggested_fee` returned in
`/construction/metadata`. The automated Construction API tester supports
running a "dry run" of a transaction broadcast if you set the follow field:
* `<scenario>.dry_run = true`

The suggested fee will then be stored as `<scenario>.suggested_fee` for use by
other `Scenarios` in the same `Job`. You can find an example of this in the
Bitcoin [config](examples/configuration/bitcoin.json).

*If this field is not populated or set to `false`, the transaction
will be constructed, signed, and broadcast.*

#### End Conditions
When running the `rosetta-cli` in a CI job, it is usually desired to exit
when certain conditions are met (or before then with an exit code of 1). We
provide this functionality through the use of "end conditions" which can be
specified in your configuration file.

##### check:data
A full list of `check:data` end conditions can be found [here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sidhujag/rosetta-cli/configuration#DataEndConditions).
If any end condition is satisifed, we will exit and output the
results in `results_output_file` (if it is populated).

##### check:construction
The `check:construction` end condition is a map of
workflow:count that indicates how many of each workflow
should be performed before `check:construction` should stop.
For example, `{"create_account": 5}` indicates that 5 `create_account`
workflows should be performed before stopping.

Unlike `check:data`, all `check:construction` end conditions
must be satisifed before the `rosetta-cli` will exit.

#### Disable Complex Checks
If you are just getting started with your implementation, you may want
to disable balance tracking (did any address balance go below zero?) and
reconciliation (does the balance I calculated match the balance returned
by the `/account/balance` endpoint?). Take a look at the
[simple configuration](examples/configuration/simple.json) for an example of
how to do this.

#### Status Codes
If there are no issues found while running `check`, it will exit with a `0` status code.
If there are any issues, it will exit with a `1` status code. It can be useful
to run this command as an integration test for any changes to your implementation.

### Commands
#### version
```
Print rosetta-cli version

Usage:
  rosetta-cli version [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for version

Global Flags:
      --block-profile string        Save the pprof block profile in the specified file
      --configuration-file string   Configuration file that provides connection and test settings.
                                    If you would like to generate a starter configuration file (populated
                                    with the defaults), run rosetta-cli configuration:create.

                                    Any fields not populated in the configuration file will be populated with
                                    default values.
      --cpu-profile string          Save the pprof cpu profile in the specified file
      --mem-profile string          Save the pprof mem profile in the specified file
```

#### check:data
```
Check all server responses are properly constructed, that
there are no duplicate blocks and transactions, that blocks can be processed
from genesis to the current block (re-orgs handled automatically), and that
computed balance changes are equal to balance changes reported by the node.

When re-running this command, it will start where it left off if you specify
some data directory. Otherwise, it will create a new temporary directory and start
again from the genesis block. If you want to discard some number of blocks
populate the start_index filed in the configuration file with some block index.
Starting from a given index can be useful to debug a small range of blocks for
issues but it is highly recommended you sync from start to finish to ensure
all correctness checks are performed.

By default, account balances are looked up at specific heights (instead of
only at the current block). If your node does not support this functionality,
you can disable historical balance lookups in your configuration file. This will
make reconciliation much less efficient but it will still work.

If check fails due to an INACTIVE reconciliation error (balance changed without
any corresponding operation), the cli will automatically try to find the block
missing an operation. If historical balance disabled is true, this automatic
debugging tool does not work.

To debug an INACTIVE account reconciliation error without historical balance lookup,
set the interesting accounts to the path of a JSON file containing
accounts that will be actively checked for balance changes at each block. This
will return an error at the block where a balance change occurred with no
corresponding operations.

If your blockchain has a genesis allocation of funds and you set
historical balance disabled to true, you must provide an
absolute path to a JSON file containing initial balances with the
bootstrap balance config. You can look at the examples folder for an example
of what one of these files looks like.

Usage:
  rosetta-cli check:data [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for check:data

Global Flags:
      --block-profile string        Save the pprof block profile in the specified file
      --configuration-file string   Configuration file that provides connection and test settings.
                                    If you would like to generate a starter configuration file (populated
                                    with the defaults), run rosetta-cli configuration:create.

                                    Any fields not populated in the configuration file will be populated with
                                    default values.
      --cpu-profile string          Save the pprof cpu profile in the specified file
      --mem-profile string          Save the pprof mem profile in the specified file
```

#### check:construction
```
The check:construction command runs an automated test of a
Construction API implementation by creating and broadcasting transactions
on a blockchain. In short, this tool generates new addresses, requests
funds, constructs transactions, signs transactions, broadcasts transactions,
and confirms transactions land on-chain. At each phase, a series of tests
are run to ensure that intermediate representations are correct (i.e. does
an unsigned transaction return a superset of operations provided during
construction?).

Check out the https://github.com/sidhujag/rosetta-cli/tree/master/examples
directory for examples of how to configure this test for Bitcoin and
Ethereum.

Right now, this tool only supports transfer testing (for both account-based
and UTXO-based blockchains). However, we plan to add support for testing
arbitrary scenarios (i.e. staking, governance).

Usage:
  rosetta-cli check:construction [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for check:construction

Global Flags:
      --block-profile string        Save the pprof block profile in the specified file
      --configuration-file string   Configuration file that provides connection and test settings.
                                    If you would like to generate a starter configuration file (populated
                                    with the defaults), run rosetta-cli configuration:create.

                                    Any fields not populated in the configuration file will be populated with
                                    default values.
      --cpu-profile string          Save the pprof cpu profile in the specified file
      --mem-profile string          Save the pprof mem profile in the specified file
```

#### configuration:create
```
Create a default configuration file at the provided path

Usage:
  rosetta-cli configuration:create [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for configuration:create

Global Flags:
      --block-profile string        Save the pprof block profile in the specified file
      --configuration-file string   Configuration file that provides connection and test settings.
                                    If you would like to generate a starter configuration file (populated
                                    with the defaults), run rosetta-cli configuration:create.

                                    Any fields not populated in the configuration file will be populated with
                                    default values.
      --cpu-profile string          Save the pprof cpu profile in the specified file
      --mem-profile string          Save the pprof mem profile in the specified file
```

#### configuration:validate
```
Validate the correctness of a configuration file at the provided path

Usage:
  rosetta-cli configuration:validate [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for configuration:validate

Global Flags:
      --configuration-file string   Configuration file that provides connection and test settings.
                                    If you would like to generate a starter configuration file (populated
                                    with the defaults), run rosetta-cli configuration:create.

                                    Any fields not populated in the configuration file will be populated with
                                    default values.
```

#### view:networks
```
While debugging a Data API implementation, it can be very
useful to view network(s) status. This command fetches the network
status from all available networks and prints it to the terminal.

If this command errors, it is likely because the /network/* endpoints are
not formatted correctly.

Usage:
  rosetta-cli view:networks [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for view:networks

Global Flags:
      --block-profile string        Save the pprof block profile in the specified file
      --configuration-file string   Configuration file that provides connection and test settings.
                                    If you would like to generate a starter configuration file (populated
                                    with the defaults), run rosetta-cli configuration:create.

                                    Any fields not populated in the configuration file will be populated with
                                    default values.
      --cpu-profile string          Save the pprof cpu profile in the specified file
      --mem-profile string          Save the pprof mem profile in the specified file
```

#### view:balance
```
While debugging, it is often useful to inspect the state
of an account at a certain block. This command allows you to look up
any account by providing a JSON representation of a types.AccountIdentifier
(and optionally a height to perform the query).

For example, you could run view:balance '{"address":"interesting address"}' 1000
to lookup the balance of an interesting address at block 1000. Allowing the
address to specified as JSON allows for querying by SubAccountIdentifier.

Usage:
  rosetta-cli view:balance [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for view:balance

Global Flags:
      --block-profile string        Save the pprof block profile in the specified file
      --configuration-file string   Configuration file that provides connection and test settings.
                                    If you would like to generate a starter configuration file (populated
                                    with the defaults), run rosetta-cli configuration:create.

                                    Any fields not populated in the configuration file will be populated with
                                    default values.
      --cpu-profile string          Save the pprof cpu profile in the specified file
      --mem-profile string          Save the pprof mem profile in the specified file
```

#### view:block
```
While debugging a Data API implementation, it can be very
useful to inspect block contents. This command allows you to fetch any
block by index to inspect its contents. It uses the
fetcher (https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go/tree/master/fetcher) package
to automatically get all transactions in the block and assert the format
of the block is correct before printing.

If this command errors, it is likely because the block you are trying to
fetch is formatted incorrectly.

Usage:
  rosetta-cli view:block [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help           help for view:block
      --only-changes   Only print balance changes for accounts in the block

Global Flags:
      --block-profile string        Save the pprof block profile in the specified file
      --configuration-file string   Configuration file that provides connection and test settings.
                                    If you would like to generate a starter configuration file (populated
                                    with the defaults), run rosetta-cli configuration:create.

                                    Any fields not populated in the configuration file will be populated with
                                    default values.
      --cpu-profile string          Save the pprof cpu profile in the specified file
      --mem-profile string          Save the pprof mem profile in the specified file
```

#### utils:asserter-configuration
```
In production deployments, it is useful to initialize the response
Asserter (https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go/tree/master/asserter) using
a static configuration instead of intializing a configuration dynamically
from the node. This allows a client to error on new types/statuses that may
have been added in an update instead of silently erroring.

To use this command, simply provide an absolute path as the argument for where
the configuration file should be saved (in JSON).

Usage:
  rosetta-cli utils:asserter-configuration [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for utils:asserter-configuration

Global Flags:
      --block-profile string        Save the pprof block profile in the specified file
      --configuration-file string   Configuration file that provides connection and test settings.
                                    If you would like to generate a starter configuration file (populated
                                    with the defaults), run rosetta-cli configuration:create.

                                    Any fields not populated in the configuration file will be populated with
                                    default values.
      --cpu-profile string          Save the pprof cpu profile in the specified file
      --mem-profile string          Save the pprof mem profile in the specified file
```

#### utils:train-zstd
```
Zstandard (https://github.com/facebook/zstd) is used by
rosetta-sdk-go/storage to compress data stored to disk. It is possible
to improve compression performance by training a dictionary on a particular
storage namespace. This command runs this training and outputs a dictionary
that can be used with rosetta-sdk-go/storage.

The arguments for this command are:
<namespace> <database path> <dictionary path> <max items> (<existing dictionary path>)

You can learn more about dictionary compression on the Zstandard
website: https://github.com/facebook/zstd#the-case-for-small-data-compression

Usage:
  rosetta-cli utils:train-zstd [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for utils:train-zstd

Global Flags:
      --block-profile string        Save the pprof block profile in the specified file
      --configuration-file string   Configuration file that provides connection and test settings.
                                    If you would like to generate a starter configuration file (populated
                                    with the defaults), run rosetta-cli configuration:create.

                                    Any fields not populated in the configuration file will be populated with
                                    default values.
      --cpu-profile string          Save the pprof cpu profile in the specified file
      --mem-profile string          Save the pprof mem profile in the specified file
```

## Correctness Checks
This tool performs a variety of correctness checks using the Rosetta Server. If
any correctness check fails, the CLI will exit and print out a detailed
message explaining the error.

### Response Correctness
The validator uses the autogenerated [Go Client package](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go)
to communicate with the Rosetta Server and assert that responses adhere
to the Rosetta interface specification.

### Duplicate Hashes
The validator checks that a block hash or transaction hash is
never duplicated.

### Non-negative Balances
The validator checks that an account balance does not go
negative from any operations.

### Balance Reconciliation
#### Active Addresses
The CLI checks that the balance of an account computed by
its operations is equal to the balance of the account according
to the node. If this balance is not identical, the CLI will
exit.

#### Inactive Addresses
The CLI randomly checks the balances of accounts that aren't
involved in any transactions. The balances of accounts could change
on the blockchain node without being included in an operation
returned by the Rosetta Data API. Recall that all balance-changing

## Development
* `make deps` to install dependencies
* `make test` to run tests
* `make lint` to lint the source code (included generated code)
* `make release` to run one last check before opening a PR
* `make compile version=RELEASE_TAG` to generate binaries

### Helper/Handler
Many of the packages use a `Helper/Handler` interface pattern to acquire
required information or to send events to some client implementation. An example
of this is in the `reconciler` package where a `Helper` is used to get
the account balance and the `Handler` is called to incidate whether the
reconciliation of an account was successful.

### Repo Structure
```
cmd
examples // examples of different config files
pkg
  logger // logic to write syncing information to stdout/files
  processor // Helper/Handler implementations for reconciler, storage, and syncer
  tester // test orchestrators
```
